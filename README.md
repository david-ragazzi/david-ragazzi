I'm a software engineer specialized in AI, 3D and desktop applications using Python, Django, React, QT, C#, SQL, etc.

Here are some of my projects which I created...

**NuPIC Studio (https://github.com/htm-community/nupic.studio)**
NuPIC Studio is an all-in-one tool that allows users create a HTM neural network from scratch, train it, collect statistics, and share it among the members of the community. It is not just a visualization tool but an HTM builder, debugger and laboratory for experiments).

**Ragaz Language/Compiler (https://github.com/ragazzi-robotics/ragaz)**
I created this complete language for learning purposes. It aims be a fast, safe and powerful language with python-like syntax which allow you to create from simple scripts to complex systems in a code easier to read, write and maintain than other system languages (C/C++, Rust, etc) with the same purpose)

**HTM Spelling Checker (https://github.com/david-ragazzi/HtmSpellingChecker)**
HtmSpellingChecker is an experimental spelling checker using machine learning (in special, HTM neural networks) as approach and was the theme of my master's degree dissertation (which earned me an A+ grade). Basically you train the network with a set of real world texts. After that, you give it a sentence to analyse, and if find an anomaly (ie a mispelling word) it suggest the best correction based on prediction.

Here are some of my projects which I actively colaborated...

**NuPIC (https://github.com/numenta/nupic)**
The Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing (NuPIC) is a machine intelligence platform that implements the HTM learning algorithms. HTM is a detailed computational theory of the neocortex. At the core of HTM are time-based continuous learning algorithms that store and recall spatial and temporal patterns. NuPIC is suited to a variety of problems, particularly anomaly detection and prediction of streaming data sources. 

Main contributions as committer:
- Full convertion of the NuPIC old build process (autotools, Jenkins, etc) to CMAKE which decreased complexity and the number of files in the repository (https://github.com/numenta/nupic/pull/490). Acknowledgments: http://lists.numenta.org/pipermail/nupic_lists.numenta.org/2014-February/003030.html
- Implementation of independent build process to make NuPIC Core independent of NuPIC (https://github.com/numenta/nupic.core/pull/47).
- Active participation in the restructuring of the NuPIC Core repository.
- Active participation in the restructuring of the NuPIC repository.
- Active participation in the efforts to make NuPIC installable with PIP (https://github.com/numenta/nupic/pull/1579).

**NuPIC Core (https://github.com/numenta/nupic.core)**
This repository contains the C++ source code for the Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing (NuPIC). It will eventually contain all algorithms for NuPIC, but is currently in a transition period. 

There are other projects which I created and are not listed here, but at moment are private projects.
